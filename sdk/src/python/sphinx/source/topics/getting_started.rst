Getting Started with Flywheel SDK
*********************************

Introduction
------------
The Flywheel SDK is a python toolbox that provides programmatic 
access to the Flywheel API endpoints.

License
-------
Flywheel SDK has an MIT-based `license <https://github.com/flywheel-io/core/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.

Installation
------------
The latest python package can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install flywheel-sdk

The python wheel can also be downloaded from the `Releases Page <https://github.com/flywheel-io/core/releases>`_.

API Key
-------
The SDK requires an API key. You can find and generate your key on the Flywheel profile page. It will look like this:

.. image:: //core/static/images/api-key.png

Making API Calls
----------------
In order to make API calls, you will need to create an instance of the Flywheel client:

.. code-block:: python

	# import flywheel package
	import flywheel

	# Create client
	fw = flywheel.Flywheel('my-key')

Once you have a client instance, you can interact with the system. For instance, you could get information about yourself:

.. code-block:: python

	self = fw.get_current_user()
	print('I am %s %s' % (self.firstname, self.lastname))

.. _dealing-with-files:

Dealing with Files
------------------
Often times you'll find yourself wanting to upload or download file data to one of Flywheel's containers. When uploading,
you can either specify the path to the input file, or you can specify some in-memory data to upload using the FileSpec object.

.. code-block:: python

	# Upload the file at /tmp/hello.txt
	fw.upload_file_to_project(project_id, '/tmp/hello.txt')

	# Upload the data 'Hello World!'
	file_spec = flywheel.FileSpec('hello.txt', 'Hello World!\n', 'text/plain')
	fw.upload_file_to_project(project_id, file_spec)

	% Some endpoints allow multiple file uploads:
	fw.upload_output_to_analysis(analysis_id, ['/tmp/hello1.txt', '/tmp/hello2.txt'])

When downloading, you specify the destination file, or you can download directly to memory

.. code-block:: python

	# Download file to /tmp/hello.txt
	fw.download_file_from_project(project_id, 'hello.txt', '/tmp/hello.txt')

	# Download file contents directly to memory
	data = fw.download_file_from_project_as_data(project_id, 'hello.txt')

Object IDs
----------
With the exception of Groups, all containers and objects within Flywheel are referenced using Unique IDs.
Groups are the only object that have a human-readable id (e.g. ``flywheel``).

Finding the ID of an object when you are only familiar with the label can be difficult. One method that may 
help is the :meth:`~flywheel.flywheel.Flywheel.resolve` method.

Resolve takes a path (by label) to an object in the system, and if found, returns the full path to that object,
along with children. For example, to find the ID of the project labeled ``Anxiety Study`` that belongs to the ``flywheel`` 
group, I would call resolve with: ``'flywheel/Anxiety Study'``:

.. code-block:: python

	# Resolve project by id
	result = fw.resolve('flywheel/Anxiety Study')

	# Extract the resolved project id
	project_id = result.path[-1].id

	# Print the ids and labels of the path elements
	for el in result.path:
		print('%s: %s' % (el.label, el.id))

	# Print the children of project:
	for el in result.children:
		print('%s: %s' % (el.label, el.id))

Handling Exceptions
-------------------
When an error is encountered while accessing an endpoint, an :class:`flywheel.rest.ApiException` is thrown. 
The ApiException will typically have a ``status`` which is the HTTP Status Code (e.g. 404) and a ``reason`` 
(e.g. Not Found).

For example:

.. code-block:: python

	try:
	  project = fw.get_project('NON_EXISTENT_ID')
	except flywheel.ApiException as e:
	  print('API Error: %d -- %s' % (e.status, e.reason))
