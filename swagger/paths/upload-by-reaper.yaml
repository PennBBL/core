      created in referenced project/group.


      ### Evaluation Order:
      
      * If a matching acquisition UID is found anywhere on the system, the related files will be placed under that acquisition.
      * **OR** If a matching session UID is found, a new acquistion is created with the specified UID under that Session UID.
      * **OR** If a matching group ID and project label are found, a new session and acquisition will be created within that project
      * **OR** If a matching group ID is found, a new project and session and acquisition will be created within that group.
      * **OR** A new session and acquisition will be created within a special "Unknown" group and project, which is only visible to system administrators.
