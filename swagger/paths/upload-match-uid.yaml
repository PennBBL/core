      ### Default behavior:
      > Accepts uploads to an existing data hierarchy, matched via Session and Acquisition UID
        See ``api/schemas/input/uidmatchupload.json`` for the format of this metadata.

      ### Signed URL upload with ``ticket``
      > Upload a single file directly to the storage backend. The workflow is the following:

        - Send a request with an empty ``?ticket=`` query parameter to get an upload ticket and URL
        - Upload the file using a PUT request to the upload URL
        - Once done, send a POST request to this endpoint with the upload ticket to finalize the upload.
        The file will be placed into the DB via this POST request.
