### Testing API against RAML with Abao
Abao is one of the testing tools run during our TravisCI build.  It tests the API implementation against whatâ€™s defined in the RAML spec.  Adding a new resource / url to the RAML spec will cause Abao to verify that resource during integration tests.  Sometimes abao cannot properly test a resource (file field uploads) or a test may require chaining variable.  Abao has before and after hooks for tests, written in javascript.  These can be used to skip a test, inject variables into the request, or make extra assertions about the response.  See tests/integration/abao in the repo for the hooks file.  See [abao github readme](https://github.com/cybertk/abao/blob/master/README.md) for more information on how to use hooks.

Abao tests can depend on specific resources (eg. group, project, session, etc.) pre-existing in the DB. That resource loading should be maintained within `test/integration_tests/abao/load_fixture.py` and is executed automatically via the integration test scripts at `test/bin`.
