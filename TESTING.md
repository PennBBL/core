## Run the tests

### Ubuntu
Run automated tests:
```
# Follow installation instructions in README first
. /runtime/bin/activate # Or wherever your scitran virtualenv is
./test/bin/setup-integration-tests-ubuntu.sh
./test/bin/run-tests-ubuntu.sh
```
* To skip linting, use `--no-lint` (`-L`)
* To skip unit tests, use `--no-unit` (`-U`)
* To skip integration tests, use `--no-integ` (`-I`)
* To pass any arguments to `py.test`, use `-- PYTEST_ARGS`

### Docker
Build scitran-core image and run automated tests in a docker container:
```
./test/bin/run-tests-docker.sh
```
* To skip building the image, use `--no-build` (`-B`)
* To pass any arguments to `run-tests-ubuntu.sh`, use `-- TEST_ARGS`

#### Example
Without rebuilding the image, run only unit tests matching `foo`, use the highest verbosity level for test output and jump into a python debugger session in case an assertion fails:
```
./test/bin/run-tests-docker.sh -B -- -L -I -- -k foo -vvv --pdb
```

### Tools
- [abao](https://github.com/cybertk/abao/)

### Testing API against RAML with Abao
Abao is one of the testing tools run during our TravisCI build.  It tests the API implementation against whatâ€™s defined in the RAML spec.  Adding a new resource / url to the RAML spec will cause Abao to verify that resource during integration tests.  Sometimes abao cannot properly test a resource (file field uploads) or a test may require chaining variable.  Abao has before and after hooks for tests, written in javascript.  These can be used to skip a test, inject variables into the request, or make extra assertions about the response.  See tests/integration/abao in the repo for the hooks file.  See [abao github readme](https://github.com/cybertk/abao/blob/master/README.md) for more information on how to use hooks.

Abao tests can depend on specific resources (eg. group, project, session, etc.) pre-existing in the DB. That resource loading should be maintained within `test/integration_tests/abao/load_fixture.py` and is executed automatically via the integration test scripts at `test/bin`.
